# Redshift-Python-JupyterNB-RemoteDevelopment
I created a Redshift cluster using Jupyter, set up a security group, and utilized libraries such as pg8000, psycopg2, and boto3. I also associated the cluster with an IAM role, loaded data into tables, and troubleshooted errors related to data quality during the loading process.
